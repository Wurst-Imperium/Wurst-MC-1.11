# Wurst Client ![downloads counter](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B2YeSS9tm5zLMF9NWjNZYnNqSTA)

## About

Wurst is a so-called "hacked client" for Minecraft - basically a mod that allows you to cheat. You can fly on servers, see ores through walls and much more.

## Installation

### For Users

If you just want to use Wurst, [download it](https://www.wurstclient.net/download/) from the official website and [install it](https://www.wurstclient.net/how-to-install/) on your computer.

### For Developers

If you want to edit Wurst and submit Pull Requests, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Import it to Eclipse (Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace).

3. Decompile Minecraft using the [MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases), create a folder named `mc` next to `src` and put the source code in there.

4. Go to the [`patch` folder](/patch) and run `initialize.bat` (Windows) or `initialize.sh` (UNIX) (requires git to be installed and added to the path so that the script can use it).

5. Create a `lib` folder next to `src`, then add Minecraft's libraries to it. Add the missing windows libraries if on Windows in eclipse.

All errors should have disappeared by now and you should be able to launch Wurst from the Eclipse project. If not, something is wrong.

## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome! Just make sure that you submit a separate one for each new feature or bugfix that you make. You know, things get a bit messy otherwise...
